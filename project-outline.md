# Project Outline

## Option 1 - Create wrappers for commonly done automation tasks
 1. displays progress bars - already packages for this we can use
 1. when single item takes too long, option to interrupt, skip to the next
 1. provides access to parameters of wrapped functions for customizability
 1. potentially cover big areas of the ML workflow
    - data cleaning / wrangling
    - exploratory data analysis
    - feature engineering
    - model selection (compare SVM, logistic, RF, etc.)
    - parameter search for best model
    - run model, do cross-validation, and output evaluation plots (PR-curve, AUC ROC, loss curves)
